## About Fedi

Fedi creates a new way for communities and organisations to secure and use their money and data through a Federated Operating System (OS). 

We connect the most fundamental human technology — community — with freedom technologies, like Bitcoin, to level up humanity.

It's built on Fedimint, a modular open-source protocol to custody and transact bitcoin and more in a community context, built on a strong foundation of privacy.
